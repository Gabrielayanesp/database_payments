# database_payments
This project is a small system for invoices and payments.   It uses **MySQL** for data storage, **Node.js** and **Express** for the API, and a simple **HTML + JavaScript** frontend for the dashboard.   You can manage invoices (create, read, update, delete) and run advanced queries.
